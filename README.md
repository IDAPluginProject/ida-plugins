**[Go to interactive list](https://vmallet.github.io/ida-plugins)**

## Plugins (see [interactive version](https://vmallet.github.io/ida-plugins))
203 plugins
* [3DSX Loader](https://github.com/0xEBFE/3DSX-IDA-PRO-Loader): IDA PRO Loader for 3DSX files

* [abyss](https://github.com/patois/abyss): Postprocess Hexrays Decompiler Output

* [ActionScript 3](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/ActionScript3): An ActionScript 3 processor module and Flash debugger plugin.

* [Adobe Flash disassembler](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/SWF/ReadMe.txt): The 2 plugins present in this archive will enable IDA to parse SWF files, load all SWF tags as segments for fast search and retrieval, parse all tags that can potentially contain ActionScript2 code, discover all such code(a dedicated processor module has been written for it) and even name the event functions acording to event handled in it (eg. OnInitialize). [Download](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/SWF/swf.zip)

* [alleycat](https://github.com/devttys0/ida/tree/master/plugins/alleycat): 
  *  Finds paths to a given code block inside a function
  *  Finds paths between two or more functions
  *  Generates interactive call graphs
  *  Fully scriptable

* [Amnesia](https://github.com/duo-labs/idapython): Amnesia is an IDAPython module designed to use byte level heuristics to find ARM thumb instructions in undefined bytes in an IDA Pro database. Currently, the heuristics in this module find code in a few different ways. Some instructions identify and define new code by looking for comon byte sequences that correspond to particular ARM opcodes. Other functions in this module define new functions based on sequences of defined instructions.

* [Android Debugging](https://github.com/techbliss/ADB_Helper_QT_Super_version): This version have both support for native arm debugging via usb and sdk ADV manager.

* [Android Scripts Collection](https://github.com/strazzere/android-scripts): Collection of Android reverse engineering scripts that make my life easier

* [APIScout](https://github.com/danielplohmann/apiscout): This project aims at simplifying Windows API import recovery. As input, arbitrary memory dumps for a known environment can be processed (please note: a reference DB has to be built first, using apiscout/db_builder). The output is an ordered list of identified Windows API references with some meta information, and an ApiVector fingerprint. Includes a convenience GUI wrapper for use in IDA.

* [AutoRE](https://github.com/a1ext/auto_re): Auto-renaming plugin with tagging support.

* [BinAuthor](https://github.com/g4hsean/BinAuthor): Match an author to an unknown binary.



## Credits

The original list of 200 plugins came from
[onethawt](https://github.com/onethawt)'s excellent
[idaplugins-list](https://github.com/onethawt/idaplugins-list). His and
other crontributors' work was essential in putting together this
interactive list.
